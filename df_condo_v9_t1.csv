(Gulf of Mexico) Siesta/Crescent Beach, Siesta Key, Sarasota, Florida 34242

Crescent Beach on Siesta Key is the world's best beach and we don't say that lightly. While some say beaches in Bali, Australia, New Zealand and/or Hawaii are as nice it's not the case - We've been there.
NO OTHER BEACH IN THE WORLD IS AS CLEAN, WHITE SAND, COOL ON THE HOTTEST DAYS, AND SAFE TO SWIM IN AS CRESCENT BEACH !!!

Travel Channel Rates Siesta Beach to the ""Elite List"": On April 6, 2003 a Travel Channel (Part of Discovery Networks) film crew shot footage on the beach. Siesta Beach was chosen to the ""Elite"" list by a panel of beach experts reviewing criteria such as cleanliness, sand quality and surrounding area. The secret of Siesta Key's sand is that the ancient sand crystals have been worn smooth over time. The sand is clean, powder soft to the touch, free of shell particles and cool on the feet. This is not the first time that Siesta Beach has won an award. In a USA Today poll Siesta Beach was voted one of the 3 top USA beaches. Conde Nast Traveler Magazine ranked Siesta Beach as being one of the ""Best of the Best"" in 1999. In 1987 the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution gave Siesta Beach the designation of having the ""Whitest, Finest Beach Sand in the World"", a title that still stands today. Siesta Beach was selected ""TOP Mainland USA Beach"" by Dr. Beach in 2008 and 2011.

The building is about 200 yards from the private beach equipped with lounges and chairs. There is no road to cross to get to the beach.

Many golf courses (50+) are available for you to play within 30-45 minutes drive. Prices are reasonable, even in High Season, with 18 holes and cart from $40 and up tax included.

Sarasota is located about 1 hour south of Tampa/St.Petersburg on the West coast of Florida on beautiful Gulf of Mexico.
There are numerous International airports close to Sarasota.
In Sarasota is the Sarasota/Bradenton (SRQ) International airport.
Tampa(TPA)/St. Petersburg(PIE) is located about 1 hour north on I-75.
Orlando(MCO)/Sanford(SFB) is about 2 hours northeast on I-75 & I-4.
Ft. Myers(RSW) is about 75 minutes south on I-75.
Fort Lauderdale(FLL) and Miami(MIA) are about 3 hours southeast on I-75.
If you are going to rent a car then just fly into the airport that gives you the least expensive Total Price.
For you in the colder North, St. Petersburg or Tampa is usually the cheapest.

 Hi, I'm Korean girl has been living here for 6 years. :)
 Easy-going, Clean, Simple and Responsible 
 There's one more reliable girl living in a bigger room who has been living since this year.
 We've been staying here with respecting our privacies the most.
 I have a 6 years old small cat, named Myulchi (It means 'Anchovy' in Korean :D).
 She is friendly, calm, charming and loves to be around people.
 I try my best to be responsible to care her feeding, cleaning, and playing.
 It would be greater if you are familiar with cats!

I'm looking for a roommate to share my condo. You'll be renting the private room in the spacious condo (750 square feet). Internet and utilities not included. We'll be sharing the kitchen, living room, and balcony. The condo comes with washer/dryer, fridge, microwave, etc. The balcony faces the quiet courtyard. There's also beautiful view of the giant park next to the building.

The condo's located at Bathurst & Fort York. The location is in a new/upscale residential area, 5 minutes from a Sobey's. It's central and walkable, 10 min walk to Rogers Centre, 10 min walk to Front Street.

The building itself is around 3 years old, comes with great amenities you'd expect from a new condo (exercise room, sauna, outdoor jacuzzi, basketball court). You'll have access to this and it's perfect for someone with an active lifestyle.

The room itself was marked as a den (see the floorplan), but is a completely separate room with installed door and enclosed walls. It's relatively large, 9.5 x 9 ft, current fits a queen bed, a closet and a small desk.

The condo is unfurnished as it stands (I'm just moving in December, but I'm planning on furnishing it as time progresses). If you have a bed and things you want to put in your room, great. A bed can be provided if need be.

I'm early 32 male, working in the design/tech field. I'm quiet, clean and friendly. I'm moving in December from the suburbs and want to see what the city has to offer. I enjoy a mix of spending quiet time indoors and exploring the city.

I'm looking for preferably a young professional or mature student. Clean, personable and prefers a quiet environment. I'm pretty reasonable when it comes to rules, but ask that you respect the common areas and clean up after yourself. No overnight guests but don't mind friends coming over, as long as you give me a heads up.

The room is available as of January 1st, 2017. Please include:

-Proof of income and employment
-1st & last month deposit (1 year lease)
-References

If interested, please reach out to me via email. Include a little intro about yourself and what you do. A LinkedIn profile would be great. I'll ask for a brief 5 min coffee, just to make sure we have compatible lifestyles.

 (Gulf of Mexico) Siesta/Crescent Beach, Siesta Key, Sarasota, Florida 34242

 Crescent Beach on Siesta Key is the world's best beach and we don't say that lightly. While some say beaches in Bali, Australia, New Zealand and/or Hawaii are as nice it's not the case - We've been there.
 NO OTHER BEACH IN THE WORLD IS AS CLEAN, WHITE SAND, COOL ON THE HOTTEST DAYS, AND SAFE TO SWIM IN AS CRESCENT BEACH !!!

 Travel Channel Rates Siesta Beach to the ""Elite List"": On April 6, 2003 a Travel Channel (Part of Discovery Networks) film crew shot footage on the beach. Siesta Beach was chosen to the ""Elite"" list by a panel of beach experts reviewing criteria such as cleanliness, sand quality and surrounding area. The secret of Siesta Key's sand is that the ancient sand crystals have been worn smooth over time. The sand is clean, powder soft to the touch, free of shell particles and cool on the feet. This is not the first time that Siesta Beach has won an award. In a USA Today poll Siesta Beach was voted one of the 3 top USA beaches. Conde Nast Traveler Magazine ranked Siesta Beach as being one of the ""Best of the Best"" in 1999. In 1987 the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution gave Siesta Beach the designation of having the ""Whitest, Finest Beach Sand in the World"", a title that still stands today. Siesta Beach was selected ""TOP Mainland USA Beach"" by Dr. Beach in 2008 and 2011.

 The building is about 200 yards from the private beach equipped with lounges and chairs. There is no road to cross to get to the beach.

 Many golf courses (50+) are available for you to play within 30-45 minutes drive. Prices are reasonable, even in High Season, with 18 holes and cart from $40 and up tax included.

 Sarasota is located about 1 hour south of Tampa/St.Petersburg on the West coast of Florida on beautiful Gulf of Mexico.
 There are numerous International airports close to Sarasota.
 In Sarasota is the Sarasota/Bradenton (SRQ) International airport.
 Tampa(TPA)/St. Petersburg(PIE) is located about 1 hour north on I-75.
 Orlando(MCO)/Sanford(SFB) is about 2 hours northeast on I-75 & I-4.
 Ft. Myers(RSW) is about 75 minutes south on I-75.
 Fort Lauderdale(FLL) and Miami(MIA) are about 3 hours southeast on I-75.
 If you are going to rent a car then just fly into the airport that gives you the least expensive Total Price.
 For you in the colder North, St. Petersburg or Tampa is usually the cheapest.

NO OTHER BEACH IN THE WORLD IS AS CLEAN, WHITE SAND, COOL ON THE HOTTEST DAYS, AND SAFE TO SWIM IN AS CRESCENT BEACH !!!

Travel Channel Rates Siesta Beach to the ""Elite List"": On April 6, 2003 a Travel Channel (Part of Discovery Networks) film crew shot footage on the beach. Siesta Beach was chosen to the ""Elite"" list by a panel of beach experts reviewing criteria such as cleanliness, sand quality and surrounding area. The secret of Siesta Key's sand is that the ancient sand crystals have been worn smooth over time. The sand is clean, powder soft to the touch, free of shell particles and cool on the feet. This is not the first time that Siesta Beach has won an award. In a USA Today poll Siesta Beach was voted one of the 3 top USA beaches. Conde Nast Traveler Magazine ranked Siesta Beach as being one of the ""Best of the Best"" in 1999. In 1987 the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution gave Siesta Beach the designation of having the ""Whitest, Finest Beach Sand in the World"", a title that still stands today. Siesta Beach was selected ""TOP Mainland USA Beach"" by Dr. Beach in 2008 and 2011.

With Historical charm One of the real treats of  renting downtown Toronto condos is the potential for historic connection. The Waldorf Astoria Lofts, originally built in the 1960's, is one of those select properties that offer residences not only a fully modern home but also a link to Toronto's past. So if you like the idea of a charming building full of stories and memories, then The Waldorf Astoria Lofts might be the place to add your own.

Friendly vibe along Charles Street East, a quaint, tree-lined street with a mix of established homes and new up-and-coming developments. Only a short walk from Church Street, the neighbourhood is fun and friendly, perfect for evening strolls, easy trips to Yonge Street and the Eaton Centre, or simply staying home with the songs of birds in the trees.

Fitness facilities: Rare among Toronto lofts, The Waldorf Astoria Lofts offer residences a fitness facility replete with a sauna and a rooftop deck. For those who are short of time or finances to join an outside gym, these amenities will make it easy and relaxing to stay active during the winter months.

With an historic loft home at 80 Charles Street East, you will live just a short walk from one of Toronto's most popular intersections. The Yonge and Bloor neighbourhood offers an exciting mosaic of the downtown living experience, with the central TTC junction pulling it all together. You will enjoy a smooth blend of business, fashion, artistry, and entertainment, from Yonge Street nightlife and cultural events to Bloor Street restaurants and cafes, Yorkville boutique shopping, and Bay Street business bustle.

When you live at 16 Brookers Lane, there's never a shortage of things to do and places to go.

Just outside of the front door of the building, you can grab a sub or some sushi, get your dry cleaning done, get a tan or get your nails done, grab a coffee or ice cream, or even take your dog or cat to the vet.  You can walk to the lakefront trail and snap a selfie on the Humber Bay bridge, or ride your bike all the way to the Exhibition grounds.

The Farmer's Market is just down the street, and there's a yearly Waterfront Festival as well.  Just a short distance away, you'll find hundreds of local shops along the Lakeshore.

Inside the building, there's even more to do.  Whether you choose to go for a swim, hit the sauna, watch a movie in the theatre, or have a BBQ on the rooftop terrace, you'll enjoy the amenities in the building on a regular basis.

The unit is a one-bedroom, 574 square feet plus an extra 135 square feet of balcony space.  The high nine-foot ceilings and large south-facing windows with lake views will provide enjoyment every day.  There's one parking space close to the elevator, and one locker included with the condo.

The building is pet-friendly, with a wide mix of residents from singles to young families.  There's easy access to highways and transit, with a more relaxed pace compared to downtown.  But if you want to get there, it won't take long at all when you live in this super convenient location.

Enjoy everything this condo unit, building and area have to offer you!

Come sink your feet into the sand thats never hot!!!! Siesta Key, FL has been voted the best beach in America for 3 straight years, thanks to the gorgeous white, 99% crushed quartz sands, that don't burn your feet. 
Our 2 bedroom, 1 bath GROUND FLOOR condo is right across the street from the public beach. No need to battle the parking wars when you're a 10 second walk away. In addition, Siesta Key is one of the only public beaches on the golf that will not only allow you to enjoy an adult beverage or two, but also have concessions there so you don't have to bring a cooler. Don't like the salt water, the condo also has it's own pool, viewable from our unit. Want to go to the village for shopping, dining or drinks?? No problem, you can either walk the short distance(under a mile) or call Jonnys Free Beach Rides (jonnysfreebeachride.homestead.com/), one of a few services that offer a tip only cost ride to the village an back. This is truly the best location for a beach vacation!!

The unique colored glass architecture of the building exterior is inspired by the abundant green spaces of Historical Fort York located across the street, as well as the abstraction of books lining a shelf. Residents enjoy the Author's Club, a three-level pavilion with views overlooking the park.
Along with stunning balcony views of Lake Ontario and Downtown, residents have easy access to grocery stores, fine dining and taking in everything Toronto offers nearby, such as the Rogers Centre, Air Canada Centre, Harbor Front and Billy Bishop Airport.

If you are coming to Toronto for an extended stay or searching for permanent housing, you have to consider how much you can spend on accommodations. Staying at a hotel can result in a very expensive accommodation bill. For many people, staying in a short term rental furnished apartment is a popular choice. These apartments provide guests with all of the luxuries of a hotel except they provide a home-away-from-home environment. The prices are much more affordable than a hotel and they are available for weekly or monthly stays. 



Short term furnished apartments rentals provide all of the comforts and conveniences of a modern home. They contain lavish bedrooms, completely functional kitchens, spacious and decorated rooms, quality security features, and laundry services.

Hi there,

I'm moving to Toronto and in the search for a 1-bedroom (or studio) apartment in Downtown. Would you be able to help me find something? I'm finding the search is quite challenging given I'm currently based in Vancouver. I'm happy to fly out to Toronto but it seems like most landlords prefer local candidates these days.. 

I am quite flexible with where I live and the actual residence. 

Please contact me if you are able to assist.

Thanks

Library District Condos at 170 Fort York Blvd was completed in 2014. The contemporary-designed and environmentally-conscious 29 storey residential structure is an eye-catching site within the Fort York community. It gets its name in the celebration of the City of Toronto's 99th public library, located next door.
The unique colored glass architecture of the building exterior is inspired by the abundant green spaces of Historical Fort York located across the street, as well as the abstraction of books lining a shelf. Residents enjoy the Author's Club, a three-level pavilion with views overlooking the park.
Along with stunning balcony views of Lake Ontario and Downtown, residents have easy access to grocery stores, fine dining and taking in everything Toronto offers nearby, such as the Rogers Centre, Air Canada Centre, Harbor Front and Billy Bishop Airport.

I'm looking for a new housemate as my best friend is moving out of Toronto. Earliest move in date is February 1st 2018.

I'm ideally looking for a young professional like myself, someone who is social and has their own life, but may also be up for a beer every now and again. I'm a 24 year old graphic designer who works in Markham.

The apartment has excellent amenities, it's on the 5th floor with a great view of the lake and amazing sunrises. It's well equipped with a dishwasher and ensuite laundry machines.

The available room is spacious and has its own full en-suite bathroom as well as a walk-in closet. The shared living space is already fully furnished, although the bedroom will need new furniture (although my current housemate might be open to selling). 

Along with the apartment itself being great, you'll have access to a number of amenities: a gym, squash court, library/study area, hot tub, and in the summer, an outdoor pool! A few of these are located on the 4th floor terrace which is also equipped with a calisthenics equipment and a low impact walking strip for summer training, on top of that I have an electric bbq which I'd be happy to show you how to use (it's dead simple).

The building is a 15 minute walk to the GO station, a 10 minute walk to lakeshore as well as the buses accessible there, a 2 minute drive to the Gardiner, and a 1 minute drive to Metro, Shoppers and an LCBO. I honestly don't think it could have been located in a better place.

Rent is 900 per month, it's a 1 year contract, the landlord requires a letter of employment, credit check, as well as first and last.    ","43.624194,-79.488873",M8Y 4G9
